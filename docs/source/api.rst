Basic Data Types

===================================

There are 4 basic data types:

- **Integer** are numeric values with no fractional part in them. For example: 5,-10,0 are integer values. All integer values in your program must be in the range -2147483648 to +2147483647. 

- **Float** point values are numeric values that include a fractional part. For example: .5, -10.1, 0.0 are all floating point values. 

- **String** are used to contain text. For example: "Hello World!".

- **Pointer** are objects that store a memory address. This type is for solving that pointers are stored in an integer in BlitzBasic.
